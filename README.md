# burp-mcp-ColorStrike

> A Burp Suite MCP extension that enables AI-driven security analysis and offensive testing through a color-based triage workflow. Highlight requests in Burp Proxy History, then let the LLM analyze traffic by color group, identify attack vectors, and execute targeted payloads — all without leaving your chat interface.

A fork of [PortSwigger/mcp-server](https://github.com/PortSwigger/mcp-server) with a focus on manual penetration testing workflows.

## What's Different from the Original

### Color-Based Triage Workflow
Requests in Burp Proxy History are organized by highlight color. The LLM reads, groups and analyzes traffic by color — each color representing a different testing context or priority level.

### Three Read Levels
| Tool | Data | Purpose |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|
| `GetProxyHttpHistory` | Color-grouped summary — endpoint names, status codes, param names. No values, no body, no response. | Initial triage |
| `GetRequestsByColor` | Full request + response with token truncation and cookie collapsing | Group vulnerability analysis |
| `GetRequestByIndex` | 100% untruncated — full JWT, raw cookies, complete response | Surgical analysis / JWT attacks |

### Unified Attack Tool
`SendRequest` is the only tool that sends data to the target. It supports:
- **Explicit injection** via `injectAt` — `"body:param"`, `"query:param"`, `"header:Name"`, `"method"`, `"path"`
- **Marker injection** — place `{{payload}}` anywhere in the request
- **Auto injection** — JWT/Bearer auto-routes to Authorization header; fallback to last path segment
- **Differential analysis** — adaptive response output: size/status diff detection, body preview when uniform
- **Delay control** — `delaySeconds` for time-based SQLi calibration

### Real Baseline Timing
Every item in history shows `[baseline: Xms]` — the real latency captured by Burp at intercept time. Used to calibrate time-based SQLi attacks against real response times, not estimated values.

### Persistent Item IDs
Uses `ProxyHttpRequestResponse.id()` — the native Burp ID that matches the `#` column in Proxy History UI and **does not reset after history clear**.

### Backend Sanitization
Automatic pipeline on all history reads:
- JWT/Bearer tokens truncated (`eyJ...[JWT TRUNCATED]`, `Bearer [TOKEN TRUNCATED]`)
- Cookies collapsed (`[N cookies, session=abc123de...]`)
- SVG / base64 / ViewState replaced with `[TRUNCATED]`
- Static extensions filtered (images, fonts, CSS, JS, media, binaries)
- Items > 10,000 chars truncated

### HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 Auto-Detection
`SendRequest`, `CreateRepeaterTab` and `SendToIntruder` automatically detect the HTTP version from the original request and send using the correct protocol — no manual configuration needed.

- Request ending with `HTTP/2` → sent via `HttpMode.HTTP_2` using `HttpRequest.http2Request()`
- Request ending with `HTTP/1.1` → sent as raw HTTP/1.1

The detected version is reported in every `SendRequest` output:
```
version=HTTP/2 | injection=explicit(body:action) | payloads_count=3 | delay=0.5s
```

This ensures injection payloads land correctly regardless of the protocol used by the original request — critical for testing modern APIs that exclusively use HTTP/2.

## Token Economy

ColorStrike is designed to minimize LLM context usage at every layer — fewer tokens means faster responses, lower cost, and less hallucination risk from irrelevant data.

### 1. Highlight Filter — Only What Matters Reaches the LLM
Only requests you explicitly marked with a color in Burp Proxy History are delivered. Everything else — uncolored requests, static assets, noise — is discarded before any data reaches the LLM.

In a typical session with 200+ requests in Proxy History, the LLM might only see 10-15 highlighted items. That's a 90%+ reduction in input tokens on the first call.

### 2. Three Read Levels — Load Only What You Need

```
GetProxyHttpHistory     → summary only (no values, no body, no response)
                           ~500 tokens for 10 items
        ↓ (if needed)
GetRequestsByColor      → full request + response, truncated pipeline
                           ~2,000 tokens per item
        ↓ (if needed)
GetRequestByIndex       → 100% raw, untruncated — full JWT, full body
                           ~5,000+ tokens per item
```

The LLM starts at the cheapest level and only escalates when the attack vector requires it. JWT attacks always require `GetRequestByIndex` — but SQLi, IDOR, and mass assignment can be fully identified and exploited from `GetRequestsByColor` alone.

### 3. Sanitization Pipeline — Noise Removed Before Delivery
Every item passes through an automatic cleanup pipeline before reaching the LLM:

| What | Before | After |
|:-----|:-------|:------|
| JWT tokens | `eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiYWRtaW4...` (500+ chars) | `eyJ...[JWT TRUNCATED]` |
| Bearer tokens | `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...` | `Bearer [TOKEN TRUNCATED]` |
| Cookies | `_ga=GA1.2.123; _fbp=fb.1.123; session=abc123; _abck=0B5B...` | `[4 cookies, session=abc123de...]` |
| SVG / base64 | Inline data hundreds of chars long | `[TRUNCATED]` |
| ViewState | `.NET ViewState blob` | `[TRUNCATED]` |
| Oversized items | Full item > 10,000 chars | Truncated at 10,000 with `...(truncated)` |

Cookies alone can save 200-400 tokens per request. JWT truncation saves 300-600 tokens per request.

### 4. Differential Body Preview — Body Only When Useful
`SendRequest` uses adaptive output logic after each attack:

- **Sizes or status differ** between payloads → only size + status + latency shown — body is skipped because the diff is already clear
- **Sizes and status are uniform** → first 500 chars of body shown for differential content analysis

This avoids dumping full response bodies into context when a simple size difference already confirms the vulnerability.

## Workflow

```
1. Browse target with Burp intercepting
2. Highlight interesting requests with colors in Proxy History
   🔴 RED    — critical / high priority
   🟧 ORANGE — interesting / needs testing  
   🟨 YELLOW — low priority / informational
   🟩 GREEN  — confirmed safe / baseline
   🟦 BLUE   — authentication flows
   🟪 MAGENTA — business logic
   🩷 PINK   — parameters / injection points

3. Connect LLM via MCP
4. LLM reads history → groups by color → identifies attack vectors
5. LLM presents CHECKPOINT with payloads before any request is sent
6. You approve [Y/N] → LLM fires SendRequest → analyzes differential response
```

---

## System Prompt

A purpose-built system prompt (`prompt_v20.md`) drives the LLM through a structured workflow:

- **Hard trigger** — first character of response is the tool call
- **Zero-data policy** — never fabricates endpoints, CVEs or vulnerabilities
- **Passive analysis modules** — Tech Stack, Decode & Parsing, Defensive Posture, Business Logic & PII, Technical Diagnosis, Full Attack Surface, Attack Plan
- **Prior authorization protocol** — mandatory CHECKPOINT before every `SendRequest`
- **Attack arsenal** — 33 vectors from SQLi to API-Specific attacks
- **Military output format** — structured, surgical, no walls of text
